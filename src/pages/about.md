I am Nilushan Silva, a full stack & cloud developer interested about all things tech. I want to cover the entire spectrum of building a application which includes backend, frontend, data and cloud infrastructure.

I want to keep on improving my exposure to usefull technology. In the near term, I am hoping to learn more about AI, ML, Blockchain, Web3 developments.
